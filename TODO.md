# TODO

- ~~need to work on parsing other difficulty data (fractions, exponents/powers, iif maintile is something)~~
- difficulty stuff needs a total rework. see comments in [the file](/scripts/es6/difficulty.js) for more info
- ~~delay /~~ preload tiles that use mathjax to skip the parsing
- leaderboards in localStorage + maybe some leaderboard server (NODEjs, PHP?)
- TUTORIAL
- use same image for tile area and bar area (no seperation between them)
- definitely will need a cooldown to prevent spamming random arrows

# Ideas

- after each round, ~~scroll right to next room (one long background image with connection of some sort between rooms)~~
- \+ have player walking with a corridor in the background
