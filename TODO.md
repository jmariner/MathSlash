# TODO

- ~~~need to work on parsing other difficulty data (fractions, exponents/powers, iif maintile is something)~~
- ~~delay / preload tiles that use mathjax to skip the parsing~~
- leaderboards in localStorage + maybe some leaderboard server (NODEjs, PHP?)
- TUTORIAL

# Ideas

- main background: after each round, scroll right to next room (one long background image with connection of some sort between rooms)
